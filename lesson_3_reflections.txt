Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want to collaborate with others on a project!

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because it is very likely that the same file that I am working on is edited remote repository. If we automatically stay up-to-date in that situation, we might loss all our progress or have our file completely messed up.
