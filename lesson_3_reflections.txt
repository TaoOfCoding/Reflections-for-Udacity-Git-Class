Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want to collaborate with others on a project!

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because it is very likely that the same file that I am working on is edited remote repository. If we automatically stay up-to-date in that situation, we might loss all our progress or have our file completely messed up.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Clones are mainly used to download repositories from Github to local computer. Fork is essentially the Github-to-Github analogy of clone. You can clone other people's repositories into your Github account. Just like clones, no change made in your forked version will influence the original version. Branch operates on single repository that creates an essentially the same repository parallel to the existing one.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: So we can access it locally.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: I may have to resort to phone call or pair-programming without Github, and that will be a pain!

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: When my change might break the codes in master. Experimenting with the changes in branch will help us keep a working master branch all the time.
